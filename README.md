This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The personal challange for this project was to learn more about the principles of [https://getbem.com/introduction/](https://getbem.com/introduction/). In order to focus on this, I did not use any major frameworks for my solution. The original goals set by Front-end mentor are also simplified a bit by altering the gallery implementation. Additionally, the page is build with basic web accessibility in mind.
